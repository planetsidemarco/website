                Since I was 11 years old I've been involved in robotics projects from high school with
                <a class="text-link" href="http://kforce.org.nz/" target="_blank">K-Force Robotics</a> to university with
                <a class="text-link" href="http://www.ucrobotics.org.nz/" target="_blank">UC Robotics</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I went from member to captain to mentor with K-Force and both founded and was president of UC Robotics for two years.
              </p>

            <div class="paragraph fade-in-1 right-third" style="margin-top: 15vh;">
              <p>
                These projects have been based on the VEX Robotics competition program and have been an amazing part of my life and a large reason for becoming an engineer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Below are some examples of projects I've worked on in the past.

              <p>University of Canterbury Robotics Club</p>
              <p>
                When I moved to Christchurch to study mechatronics engineering, I was dissapointed to find no robotics club of any sort based at the University of Canterbury. From all my previous years experience from competing in the VEX robotics competition since 2009, I felt like it was possible to start something myself and so in 2017 I founded the UC Robotics Club with a couple friends.
              </p>
              <p>
                After founding the club, I also became president and helped grow the club from a few members to over 30+ members, running a competition team as well as mentoring school teams. We volunteered outreach for high schools and ran scrimmages based at the University which also assisted the Mechanical Department in bringing in potential future students.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the club was up and running smoothly, I stepped down at the end of 2018 to focus on my studies more and it continues to perform well and grow as a uni club for any student interested in robotics.

              <p>2014 - 2015: VEX Skyrise Competition</p>

              </div>
              <p>
                Momentum was designed and built with foreknowledge that it would act as both a prototype for a full design our team wanted to try out as well as the robot we would compete with at majority of the NZ Ladder Scrimmages which would be needed to qualify to compete at 2015 NZ Nationals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Specs of the robot included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a>4 Motor Expanding X-Drive (Torque Internal Motor Gearing)</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a>4 Motor 11.7 : 1 Reverse Double 4 Bar Lift</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a>2 Motor Conveyor Intake (2 Capacity)</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a>Passive Skyrise Intake</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The achievements the robot also managed to rack up included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a>2x Tournament Champion</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a>3x Tournament Finalist</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a>1x Design Award</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Momentum helped many teams from around the world in the development of the reverse double four bar lift, which was new to many teams. Posting regular updates and offering teams help, the design inspired many teams and became a well known robot on the vexforums.
              </p>
              <p>
                The expanding drive was designed with the intention to prevent the robot from tipping in any direction, and served it's purpose to it's full potential.

                This robot was designed and built to compete at 2014 NZ Nationals without pre-qualifying requirements. It had some special features of a special string-hanging mechanism that we were proud of.
